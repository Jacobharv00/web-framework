Things this project does & follows from Backbone.js

- Class-Based Architecture: The framework follows a class-based architecture, similar to Backbone.js, providing a clear and structured method for defining models, views, and other components.
- Generic Models and Collections: The framework allows for the use of generics in models and collections, ensuring type safety and flexibility in handling various data structures. 
- Render Methods in Views: Views in the framework come with built-in render methods, facilitating the dynamic updating of the user interface based on model data. 
- Efficient List Management: Like Backbone.js's collection management, the framework supports efficient handling and manipulation of lists, enabling operations like sorting, filtering, and iterating over items. 
- Modular View System: The framework implements a modular system for views, encouraging the development of reusable and maintainable UI components, much like Backbone.js's views.
